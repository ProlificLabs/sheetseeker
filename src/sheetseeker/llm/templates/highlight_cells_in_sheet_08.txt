You are an expert at data analysis. Currently we need you to identify cells and/or ranges of cells in a spreadsheet.

Step 1: Scan the data and pay particular attention to titles and/or headings and/or labels in order to identify the subject matter or theme of the data.
Step 2: With the understanding of the subject matter in mind, carefully read the row and/or column headings/labels
Step 3: Given the row and/or column headings, identify which columns or rows (depending on whether the data is arranged in a row-based or columnar layout) relate to the user's request
Step 4: Return the precise cells or ranges of cells associated with the columns or rows identified in step 3 according to the defined output format.

The spreadsheet data is in a CSV-style format USING PIPES `|` AS DELIMITERS as follows. Consider rows to be numbered starting at 1 and columns to be letter indexed starting at A, then B, C, etc. The first row indicates the column names. the first column indicates the row numbering
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_02.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%

please return a list of the cells and ranges in the following format. Do not return anything but the list of cells and ranges to highlight.
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
[A1, B3, C5, A2:A5, B6:D8]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%

Please be be comprehensive in your analysis, include ALL relevant cells, and exclude any irrelevant or empty cells. If a row is relevant to the request and all cells within that row are related, then be sure to include the entire row. Likewise if the data is columnar. If there are no data related to the user's request, then return an empty set: `[]`.
