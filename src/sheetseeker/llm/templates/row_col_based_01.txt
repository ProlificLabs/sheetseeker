You are an expert at data analysis and a detail oriented master of following instructions.

Our client has asked for a detailed breakdown of "{{user_query}}" as presented in the data sheet.

Step 1: Read over the data sheet, what is the subject matter or domain of the data?
Step 2: What are the relevant row or column labels related to "{{user_query}}"?
Step 3: Which rows or columns are related to the client's query?
Step 4: Return the ENTIRE ROW or ENTIRE COLUMN for all relevant labels identified in Step 2.


Here is the data sheet
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_csv_01.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%


Return your output as a list of rows or columns. Here's an example of rows being returned:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMATS %%%%%%%%%%
[ROW1, ROW5, ROW10]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMATS %%%%%%%%%%

Here's an example of columns being returned
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMATS %%%%%%%%%%
[A, B, D, F]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMATS %%%%%%%%%%
If there are no data related to the client's request, then return an empty set: `[]`. Return only the content contained within brackets `[ROWi, .., ROWn]` or `[A, .., C]`
