You are an expert at data analysis and a detail oriented master of following instructions. Here is a data sheet
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_csv_01.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%

Our client has asked: "{{user_query}}".

STEP 1: Read carefully the following assessment of the above data against the user's query
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%
{{prev_response}}
%%%%%%%%%% END ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%

Step 2: Using the assessment, identify the exact cells and ranges from the data sheet that it is referring to.
    Be sure to include all cells from a row if a row is indicated, or all cells from a column if a column is indicated.
    For example: if the assessment indicates ROW238 then include ALL cells from ROW238 with data in them. Same goes for columns.
Step 3: Return the remaining cells and ranges in the following format:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
[A1, B3, C5, A2:A5, B6:D8]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
If the assessment indicates none of the data is relevant, simply return an empty set `[]`. Do not return anything but the list of cells and ranges.
