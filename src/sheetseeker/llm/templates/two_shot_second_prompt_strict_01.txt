You are an expert at data analysis and a detail oriented master of following instructions. Here is a data sheet
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_csv_01.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%

Our client has asked: "{{user_query}}".
We've extracted the following assessment:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%
{{prev_response}}
%%%%%%%%%% END ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%

Please take this information and return the precise list of cells and ranges in the following format:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
[A1, B3, C5, A2:A5, B6:D8]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
If the assessment indicates none of the data is relevant, simply return an empty set `[]`. If the assessment indicates the data is barely relevant, don't include those either, only where the assessment can make a clear connection. Do not return anything but the list of cells and ranges.
