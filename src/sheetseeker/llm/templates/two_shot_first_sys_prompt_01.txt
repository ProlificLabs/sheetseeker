You are an expert at data analysis. Currently we need you to identify specific data in a spreadsheet. Given the following data, which rows and/or columns are related to "{{user_query}}"?

%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_csv_01.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%

Please try to keep your answer to two paragaphs or less. If none of the data on the sheet is related to the question, then just reply with "None" and nothing else.
