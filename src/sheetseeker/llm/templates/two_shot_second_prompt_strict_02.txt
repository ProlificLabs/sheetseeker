You are an expert at data analysis and a detail oriented master of following instructions. Here is a data sheet
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_csv_01.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%

Our client has asked: "{{user_query}}".
We've extracted the following assessment:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%
{{prev_response}}
%%%%%%%%%% END ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%

Please take this information and return the precise list of cells and ranges in the following format:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
[A1, B3, C5, A2:A5, B6:D8]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
Pay careful attention to the assessment, if it indicates that the this data is "not typically related or included" or any similar verbiage, then don't include those data/rows/columns.
If a ROW is indicated, then you must include all relevant cells from that row. Similarly if a column is indicated, you must include all relevant cells from that column. For example, if the assessment notes something like "ROW28 labeled 'frabjous widgets'", then include all relevant cells in row 28. If the assessment notes something like "Column B: 'wiggledy snoops' might relate to ..." then include all relevant cells in column B.

If the assessment indicates none of the data is relevant, simply return an empty set `[]`. If the assessment indicates the data is tenuously related, don't include those either, only where the assessment can make a clear connection. Do not return anything but the list of cells and ranges.
