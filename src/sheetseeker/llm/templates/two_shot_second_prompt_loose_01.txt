You are an expert at data analysis. We need you to identify specific cells and/or ranges of data in the following spreadsheet.

%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%
{% include 'data_contents_02.txt' %}
%%%%%%%%%% END SHEET DATA %%%%%%%%%%

The user has asked about "{{user_query}}". Here's our understanding of where in the sheet that data lies:
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%
{{prev_response}}
%%%%%%%%%% END ASSESSMENT %%%%%%%%%%

Given that assessment, please return the list of cells or ranges of cells which are associated with the user's query. RETURN A LIST OF THE CELLS AND RANGES IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT. DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING BUT THE LIST OF CELLS AND RANGES TO HIGHLIGHT.
%%%%%%%%%% BEGIN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
[A1, B3, C5, A2:A5, B6:D8]
%%%%%%%%%% END EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT %%%%%%%%%%
If the assessment indicates none of the data is relevant, simply return an empty set `[]`.
